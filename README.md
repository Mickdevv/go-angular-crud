Welcome! :) 

This is a pretty simple CRUD application that I build to learn Go with its standard library, hand code my own auth and CORS middleware, and reinforce my knowledge and understanding of state management.

Enjoy

# Backend
You will need to have Go 1.22 or higher installed (visit https://go.dev/doc/install) 
Once installed, open a new terminal and navigate to the backend folder inside the project.
Run `go run main.go`

# Frontend
In a terminal navigate to the root directory.
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
